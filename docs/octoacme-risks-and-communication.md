# OctoAcme â€” Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

For a comprehensive guide on risk management, including detailed scoring, categories, and best practices, see the [Risk Management Template](templates/risk-management-template.md).

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

**Quick Risk Assessment:**
- **Impact:** High (project failure/major delays) | Medium (moderate delays) | Low (minor impact)
- **Likelihood:** High (>60%) | Medium (30-60%) | Low (<30%)
- **Risk Score:** Impact Ã— Likelihood (9=Critical, 6=High, 3-4=Medium, 1-2=Low)

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

## Escalation Paths

### Standard Escalation Process

**Level 1: Team-Level (0-24 hours)**
- Blockers discussed in daily standup
- Team attempts to resolve internally
- PM informed of blocker status
- *When to escalate:* Issue persists beyond 1 business day OR impacts sprint commitment

**Level 2: PM/Product Lead (24-48 hours)**
- PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- Cross-functional coordination initiated
- Alternative solutions explored
- Stakeholders notified of potential impact
- *When to escalate:* Issue persists beyond 2 business days OR impacts project timeline/scope

**Level 3: Sponsor/Executive (48+ hours)**
- Business-impacting issues requiring executive decision
- Resource constraints or priority conflicts
- Significant timeline or scope changes needed
- *When to escalate:* Issue threatens project success OR requires budget/resource approval

### Specialized Escalation

**Security Incidents**
- Follow security incident runbook immediately
- Notify Security on-call (no delay)
- Escalate to security@octoacme and CISO within 1 hour
- Document in security incident tracker

**Production Outages**
- Trigger incident response immediately
- Notify on-call engineer and PM
- Follow incident management playbook
- Update status page within 15 minutes

### Escalation Best Practices
- Provide context: what's blocked, impact, what's been tried
- Suggest options when escalating (not just problems)
- Document escalation in project tracker
- Follow up after resolution to prevent recurrence
