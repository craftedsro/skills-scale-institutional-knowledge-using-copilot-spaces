# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Developers: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- QA/Testing: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholders: provide inputs and approvals.

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Phase Transition Criteria

### Initiation → Planning
- ✓ Project One-pager approved by stakeholders
- ✓ Success metrics clearly defined
- ✓ Team availability confirmed
- ✓ Initial risk assessment completed

### Planning → Execution
- ✓ Backlog prioritized with acceptance criteria
- ✓ Definition of Done documented
- ✓ Team kickoff meeting completed
- ✓ Initial sprint/iteration planned

### Execution → Release
- ✓ All acceptance criteria met
- ✓ Testing and QA completed
- ✓ Release notes drafted
- ✓ Rollback plan documented

### Release → Close & Retrospective
- ✓ Production deployment verified
- ✓ Stakeholders notified
- ✓ Success metrics collected
- ✓ Retrospective scheduled within 1 week

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## Phase Handoffs & Transitions

Successful handoffs between phases require clear communication and documentation:

**Key Handoff Elements:**
- Review and confirm transition criteria are met
- Update all stakeholders on phase change
- Hand off relevant artifacts and context
- Introduce any new team members joining
- Confirm next steps and timelines

**Documentation to Update at Transitions:**
- Project status and health
- Updated risk register
- Any scope or timeline changes
- Lessons learned from previous phase

For detailed handoff procedures, see [Execution & Tracking - Handoff Procedures](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md#handoff-procedures).

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
- Use templates and checklists to ensure consistency and completeness.
