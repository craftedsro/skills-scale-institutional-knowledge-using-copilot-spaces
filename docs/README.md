# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. This serves as your central reference point for understanding how we run projects, from initial concept to release and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Our processes ensure teams can deliver high-quality products efficiently while maintaining psychological safety and continuous learning.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to gather feedback early
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback and continuous learning

### Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break down work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team cadence
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with proper verification and stakeholder communication
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and define action items for improvement

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery schedules, manages risks, and facilitates communication
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Communication Cadence

- **Weekly sync**: Between PM and PdM for alignment
- **Twice-weekly standups**: For delivery team (or as agreed)
- **Monthly updates**: For stakeholders and sponsors
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for blockers and critical issues

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, we maintain these essential documents:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline of major milestones and deliverables
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Shared understanding of what "complete" means
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks with impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for continuous improvement

## Templates & Checklists

We provide comprehensive templates to support consistent execution:

- **[Project Kickoff Checklist](templates/project-kickoff-checklist.md)** - Complete guide for starting projects with all critical elements covered
- **[Risk Management Template](templates/risk-management-template.md)** - Systematic approach to identify, assess, track, and mitigate risks
- **[Retrospective Template & Facilitation Guide](templates/retrospective-template.md)** - Structured formats and techniques for effective team retrospectives

These templates are referenced throughout the process documentation and can be adapted to your project's specific needs.

## Using These Docs with Copilot Spaces

To leverage these process documents in your development workflow:

1. Keep your Project Charter updated in the project repository
2. Add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` directory if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context
3. Reference these docs when creating issues, PRs, and project plans

## Questions or Feedback?

These process documents are living resources that improve over time. If you have suggestions or questions:

- Open an issue in the repository
- Discuss in team retrospectives
- Reach out to your Project Manager or Product Lead
