# Retrospective Template & Facilitation Guide

## Purpose
Facilitate structured team reflection to capture learnings, celebrate wins, and identify actionable improvements.

## When to Use
- End of each sprint or iteration (recommended: every 2 weeks)
- After completing a major milestone or release
- Following an incident or significant challenge
- At project closure
- Anytime the team needs to reset or realign

---

## Retrospective Meeting Structure

**Duration:** 45-75 minutes (adjust based on team size and sprint length)
**Frequency:** Consistent cadence (e.g., every 2 weeks)
**Attendees:** Core delivery team (PM, PdM, Developers, QA, Design)

---

## Preparation (Before the Meeting)

### Facilitator Responsibilities
- [ ] Schedule meeting with clear time and location
- [ ] Prepare retrospective board (digital or physical)
- [ ] Review previous retrospective action items
- [ ] Review sprint/project metrics and highlights
- [ ] Choose retrospective format (see options below)
- [ ] Prepare timer and any needed materials

### Team Member Preparation
- [ ] Review work completed since last retrospective
- [ ] Reflect on what went well and what could improve
- [ ] Review outstanding action items from previous retrospective
- [ ] Come prepared to participate constructively

---

## Meeting Agenda

### 1. Set the Stage (5 minutes)
**Goal:** Create safe space and establish focus

- [ ] Welcome and thank team for participation
- [ ] Remind team of retrospective purpose and norms
  - Focus on process and practices, not people
  - Blameless and constructive
  - Confidential - what's discussed stays in the room
  - All input is valuable
- [ ] State the focus area (last sprint, project phase, incident, etc.)
- [ ] Choose an icebreaker (optional but recommended)

**Icebreaker Examples:**
- One word to describe the sprint
- Weather report: How are you feeling? (sunny, cloudy, stormy)
- Share one thing you learned this sprint

### 2. Gather Data (10-15 minutes)
**Goal:** Collect input from all team members

Choose a format and have team members add their thoughts:

#### Standard Format: What Went Well / What Could Be Better
```
What Went Well (Celebrate!) üéâ
- [Team member 1's input]
- [Team member 2's input]

What Could Be Better (Improve) üîß
- [Team member 1's input]
- [Team member 2's input]
```

#### Alternative Format: Start/Stop/Continue
```
Start (What should we begin doing?) üöÄ
- [Input]

Stop (What should we stop doing?) üõë
- [Input]

Continue (What's working well?) ‚úÖ
- [Input]
```

#### Alternative Format: 4 L's
```
Liked (What did we enjoy?) ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [Input]

Learned (What did we discover?) üí°
- [Input]

Lacked (What was missing?) ‚ùì
- [Input]

Longed For (What did we wish for?) ‚≠ê
- [Input]
```

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Use silent writing time (5-7 min) before sharing
- Encourage specific examples over generalizations
- Use anonymous input tools if team needs safety
- Ensure everyone contributes

### 3. Generate Insights (15-20 minutes)
**Goal:** Find patterns and root causes

- [ ] Group similar items together (affinity mapping)
- [ ] Identify themes and patterns
- [ ] Discuss and clarify items that need explanation
- [ ] Use "5 Whys" technique for important issues
- [ ] Prioritize topics for deeper discussion

**Discussion Questions:**
- What patterns do we see?
- What's within our control to change?
- What's the root cause of this issue?
- How does this impact our ability to deliver value?

### 4. Decide What to Do (15-20 minutes)
**Goal:** Create concrete, actionable improvements

- [ ] Vote on top priorities (dot voting or similar)
- [ ] Select 2-3 action items maximum (avoid overload)
- [ ] For each action item, define:
  - Specific action
  - Owner
  - Due date / timeline
  - Success criteria
  - How we'll measure progress

**Action Item Template:**
```
Action Item: [Specific, concrete action]
Why: [Problem this addresses]
Owner: [Name]
Due Date: [Date or "by next retro"]
Success Criteria: [How we'll know it worked]
How to Measure: [Specific metric or observation]
Status: Not Started
```

**Example Action Item:**
```
Action Item: Implement PR size checker in CI to flag PRs over 400 lines
Why: Large PRs are taking 3+ days to review, slowing down delivery
Owner: Dev Lead Alex
Due Date: By next sprint (Oct 30)
Success Criteria: Automated check running on all new PRs
How to Measure: Average PR review time decreases from 3 days to <1 day
Status: Not Started
```

### 5. Close (5 minutes)
**Goal:** Appreciate and commit

- [ ] Review and confirm action items and owners
- [ ] Appreciate and celebrate team and contributions
- [ ] Ask for feedback on the retrospective itself
- [ ] Thank everyone for their candor and engagement

**Closing Questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how valuable was this retrospective?
- What would make our next retrospective better?

---

## Follow-Up Actions (After the Meeting)

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Document and share retrospective notes
  - What went well
  - What could be better
  - Action items with owners and dates
  - Themes and insights
- [ ] Create tickets/issues for action items in project tracker
- [ ] Tag action items for visibility
- [ ] Send summary to stakeholders if appropriate

### Ongoing
- [ ] Check progress on action items in weekly syncs
- [ ] Update action item status as work progresses
- [ ] Celebrate when action items are completed

### Next Retrospective
- [ ] Review previous action items first thing
- [ ] Discuss what changed and what didn't
- [ ] Learn from both successes and incomplete actions

## Retrospective Formats for Different Situations

### Post-Sprint Retrospective (Standard)

## Facilitation Tips & Techniques

### Creating Psychological Safety
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Start with appreciation and celebration
- Model vulnerability by sharing your own reflections
- Enforce blameless language
- Thank people for raising difficult topics
- Protect confidentiality
- Follow up on action items to show input matters

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Allow finger-pointing or blaming individuals
- Dismiss concerns as "not important"
- Let senior voices dominate
- Skip retrospectives when "too busy"
- Create action items and forget about them

### Managing Difficult Situations

**When One Person Dominates:**
- Use silent writing time
- Round-robin sharing
- Explicitly invite quieter team members

**When Team Is Too Negative:**
- Start with "What Went Well" first
- Acknowledge difficulties then pivot to solutions
- Use "What could we try differently?" instead of "What went wrong?"

**When Team Is Complacent:**
- Share metrics showing opportunity for improvement
- Ask: "If we could change one thing to be even better?"
- Bring in external perspective or benchmarks

**When Action Items Never Get Done:**
- Review why - too many? Not prioritized? Wrong owner?
- Commit to smaller number of action items
- Make action items sprint work, not "extra"
- Escalate if systemic barriers exist

### Remote/Distributed Teams
- Use collaborative digital boards (Miro, Mural, Jamboard)
- Build in extra time for typing vs talking
- Use breakout rooms for small group discussions
- Vary formats to keep engagement high
- Record for those who can't attend live

---

## Metrics to Consider

Track over time to see improvement trends:
- Sprint velocity
- Cycle time (idea to production)
- PR review time
- Bug escape rate
- Team satisfaction scores
- Action item completion rate

---

## Retrospective Anti-Patterns to Avoid

üö´ **The Complaint Session:** All problems, no solutions
**Fix:** Immediately ask "What could we do about this?"

üö´ **The Status Meeting:** Just reporting what happened
**Fix:** Focus on insights, learnings, and improvements

üö´ **The Blame Game:** Pointing fingers at individuals
**Fix:** Enforce blameless norms, focus on systems

üö´ **The Groundhog Day:** Same issues every time, no change
**Fix:** Ensure action items have owners and actually get done

üö´ **The Skip:** "We're too busy, let's skip it"
**Fix:** Make retrospectives non-negotiable, shorten if needed

üö´ **The Theater:** Going through motions without genuine reflection
**Fix:** Change formats, get external facilitator, address trust issues
