## Red Flags to Address Immediately

Watch for and address these warning signs during kickoff:

üö© **Unclear Objectives**
- Success metrics are vague or unmeasurable
- Different team members have different understanding of goals
- **Action:** Pause and align on clear, measurable objectives

üö© **Missing Key Roles**
- No clear Product Manager or owner
- Technical Lead not identified
- QA approach undefined
- **Action:** Escalate to get roles filled before proceeding

üö© **Scope Confusion**
- "We'll figure it out as we go" mentality
- Disagreement on what's in/out of scope
- **Action:** Document scope explicitly, get agreement

üö© **Unrealistic Timeline**
- Timeline doesn't account for dependencies or risks
- Team capacity not validated
- **Action:** Re-estimate with team input, escalate if needed

üö© **Dependency Overload**
- Project success depends on multiple external teams
- No clear ownership of dependency coordination
- **Action:** Create dependency management plan, assign coordinator

üö© **Poor Team Availability**
- Team members heavily allocated to other projects
- Key skills not available when needed
- **Action:** Negotiate for adequate capacity or adjust scope/timeline

## Tips for Effective Kickoffs

### Do:
‚úÖ Create psychological safety - emphasize learning and iteration
‚úÖ Encourage questions and diverse perspectives
‚úÖ Use visual aids (architecture diagrams, timeline charts)
‚úÖ Keep energy high with breaks and interactive elements
‚úÖ Document decisions and rationale in real-time
‚úÖ Follow up promptly with action items

### Don't:
‚ùå Skip the kickoff to "save time" - it costs more later
‚ùå Rush through important discussions
‚ùå Let technical details derail high-level alignment
‚ùå Make decisions without key stakeholders present
‚ùå Ignore or downplay risks and concerns
‚ùå Assume everyone has the same context
